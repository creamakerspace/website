We aim to be reasonable with refunds, however, we reduce refunds by any non-refundable fees charged by our payment processor.

- For memberships, you must request the refund within 30 days of being charged for an unused membership.

- For classes, you must cancel at least 48 hours prior to the event.

- For materials, products, or goods, you must return the item within 30 days in its original condition. There are no refunds for items that have been customized or modified.

To request a refund, ask in-person or email us at {{ link(email="support@creamakerspace.com") }}. You may select either:
- Makerspace Credit - refund for the full amount toward other services or products at Crea.
- Refund to your payment method - for card payments, the refund will be reduced by our payment processing fees (up to 3.5% for credit cards).
