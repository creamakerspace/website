  What we do know: we are planning to open a [makerspace](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/) in or near the Skyway neighborhood. We are working to provide a space with equipment, classes, and events initially focused on woodworking and electronics.
  
  
  We will provide additional updates as we get further into our planning process.
