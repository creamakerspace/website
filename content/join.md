_Members get access to our makerspace and [equipment](/equipment) to work on their own projects._

If you've never visited Crea before, we recommend visiting on an Open House night or <a href="https://calendly.com/creamakerspace/meet">scheduling a tour</a>.


### Open House Tuesdays

{% message(header="Referral Bonus", class="is-info mt-6") %}

Help our maker community grow, and we'll apply a credit toward your next monthly renewal!
Members will receive a credit for each referral that becomes a new member:

<ul>
<li>$50 credit if your referral signs up for the Maker Membership plan</li>
<li>$20 credit if your referral signs up for the Starter Membership plan</li>
</ul>

{% end %}

<div class="is-size-7 pt-5">

Notes:
- Some equipment requires completion of [training class](https://bookwhen.com/creamakerspace?tags=certification#focus=ev-s96l-20230808183000).
- Unlimited usage is still subject to reasonable usage and sharing of the equipment.
- 24/7 access for Pro members requires a background check.
- Family discounts limited to single billing account, for members of your household or immediate family, and apply to lesser or equal plans.
- All plans automatically renew each month, but you can <a href="faq#how-do-i-cancel-my-membership">cancel</a> or change your plan at any time with no hassle.
- Referral bonus can only be claimed by existing members who refer a first-time member (that is not part of a family plan).
- Discounts don't stack. Pick one.

### Can I use the space without a membership?

We offer a day pass for $20, but it is more limited than membership. If you're looking to "try out" the makerspace, it is usually more cost effective to take advantage of the 50% discount for your first month of membership, and simply cancel if you decide membership isn't right for you. For more details on the day pass, see our [FAQ: Can I use the space without a membership?](/faq#can-i-use-the-space-without-a-membership)

Our priority is building an active community of makers, and we believe membership is the best experience for that.


<!--
### Sponsorships

If you're interested in making an investment in the maker community near Renton, our first suggestion is to simply sponsor a membership for someone you know. Beyond that, we also make it possible to purchase a sponsorship in 3 or 12 month bundles:

Sponsor a "Maker" membership:

<button class="button is-primary is-outlined">3 months: $300</button>

We'll announce any sponsorship availability at events (e.g. Open House Tuesdays) and in our subsequent newsletter (sign up <a href="{{ newsletter_url() }}">here</a>). Applicants will be selected based on need and intended use.
