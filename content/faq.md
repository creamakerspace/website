### What days are you open?

We're open Tues-Fri 2pm-8pm, and weekends 12pm-8pm.

We're closed every Monday.

While we hope to grow and hire staff to increase our availability, in the near term,
we have manage a sustainable schedule. As such, Crea will also be closed these days:

- Tue, June 27, 2023 (Founder Vacation)
- Tue, July 4, 2023 (Independence Day)
- Thu, Nov 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving)
- Sun, Dec 24, 2023 (Christmas Eve)
- Sun, Dec 31 (New Years Eve)
- Sun, Mar 31, 2024 (Easter)
- Apr 7 - 14, 2024 (Founder Vacation)

### What is machine time usage cost?

For non-members and members on the starter plan (with a monthly usage credit), machine usage has an additional cost for the following equipment:

- Laser Cutter: $10 per 15 min
- 3D Printer: $4 per hour
- CNC Router: $15 per 30 min

If your usage costs start adding up, we recommend upgrading to the Maker membership with unlimited machine time where we don't charge you any machine time usage cost.

### What is the "guided usage cost?"

If you are not Crea-certified to operate a piece of equipment, you'll need a Crea staff member to operate it on your behalf which carries the following costs:

- 3D Printer: $20 setup plus $5 per hour of print time
- Laser Cutter: $25 per 15 min
- CNC Router: $50 per 30 min
- General Equipment Operation: $25 per 15 min

### What is "unlimited" machine time?

Unlimited machine time means there is no machine time usage cost.

Our unlimited machine time is subject to sharing and reasonable usage. Expect to take turns as necessary to ensure all members present have comparable levels of access to the equipment. Don't expect to have exclusive access to equipment for hours at a time (except for cases like 3D printing where a single print can take several hours).

If a piece of equipment is in high demand, we'll consider acquiring additional equipment to better handle the demand.

If you are looking for more substantial or exclusive access to equipment, contact us to discuss how we might accomodate your scenario.

### Can I reserve a piece of equipment?

No. We currently don't allow reserving equipment in advance.

For long-running CNC equipment, you can message us to see if it's actively available, and we can hold it as available for up to 15 minutes.

### Can Crea design something for me?

Maybe. We do have an in-house professional graphic designer that may be able to accomodate some requests, or we may be able to refer you to someone who can. Contact us to discuss design consulting services.

### Can Crea build something for me?

Probably not. Our focus is providing a space for you to build. You're welcome to ask, and we may even be able to refer you to a member who can, but we have very limited capacity for providing manufacturing services.

### What materials are available at Crea?

We try to stock some of the most common materials and supplies for convenience. Most notably, we do sell project plywood (for laser cutting) and filament (for 3D Printing), but in general, we anticipate makers will usually bring their own materials and supplies.

Commonly stocked supplies include: wood glue, staples, nails, screws, tape, and circuit components. We don't charge for trivial quantities of supplies, but if your project uses a non-trivial amount, bring your own supplies, or plan to purchase some from us.

We also have a collection of "community scraps" left by other members that are available for any projects being made in the space.

### How do I cancel my membership?

You can cancel here: [Customer Portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/4gw2aJasm65hgUw000)

You can also ask us to cancel in-person, or send an email to {{ link(email="support@creamakerspace.com") }}.

After cancellation, your membership still continues until the end of the current billing cycle.


### Can I get a refund?

See our [Refund Policy](http://localhost:1111/policies#refund-policy)

### Can I change my membership tier?

You can change it yourself from the [Customer Portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/4gw2aJasm65hgUw000)
or reach out to us to help you make the change.

### Is Crea a non-profit?

No. Crea is a small business owned by a local member of the community.

As such, we are working to both build a sustainable small business
and benefit the local community.

### Can I give equipment or materials to Crea?

Yes.

- Discuss with us first to ensure we can accomodate the equipment or materials.
- Gifted materials will become part of the "community materials".
- Crea is not a non-profit, so gifts are not tax deductible, and large gifts may have gift tax implications.
