Whether the thought of building a robot sounds intimidating or exciting, this class is for you. This is a light-hearted, artistic introduction to robots, digital circuits, and code suitable for ages 8 to 108. You'll design a simple craft robot, and we'll walk through the process of incorporating a micro:bit to bring it to life.

This is a workshop where we'll introduce you to MakeCode block programming for micro:bit. This truly requires no prior experience with code or programming, and is suitable for both kids and adults (and is probably more fun with both!). After an introduction to the micro:bit, you'll get to sketch your own robot (or animal, or character, or whatever your imagination allows), and we'll guide you through adding lights and motion to it.

In this class, you will:
- learn how to use block coding to program a micro:bit
- learn a bit about low-voltage circuits
- learn how to incorporate servos and LEDs into a micro:bit circuit
- and hopefully laugh at silly robotic creations!

Note: while you may take your robot creation home, in order to keep the cost of this class low, keeping the micro:bit does come with an additional $25 charge (you can decide whether or not to purchase the micro:bit after the class).

**Who it's for**: Anyone aged 8+ (youth 8-14 must have a guardian present, youth 8-17 must have a guardian co-sign the liability waiver). No prior experience is necessary.

**We'll provide**: Materials: a micro:bit, LEDs, servo motors, cardboard, hot glue, and markers.

**What to bring**: 
- A laptop with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge installed
- Your creativity!
- Optionally, bring your own micro:bit and/or circuit components.
