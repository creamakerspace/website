Crea is a new makerspace in Renton launched in June 2023.

We are DIYers, inventors, dreamers, and doers full of intellectual curiosity across a range of topics such as electronics, programming, 3D printing, laser cutting, woodworking, arts, crafts, and more. We are still a small community in the early stages of growing, which makes now a great time to get involved and be among the earliest members and really shape our maker community.

We are {{ map_link(text="located") }} just a few minutes away from Home Depot, Ikea, and even RE·PC (for recycled electronics). So grab some materials and start a new project in our space!


If you have any questions, or want to schedule a tour, send us an email: {{ link(email="hi@creamakerspace.com") }}.
