Crea will provide access to a variety of equipment:

- CNC equipment (3D printing, laser cutting/engraving, routing)
- A full woodshop (table tools, power tools, and hand tools)
- Robotics lab (soldering stations, Arduino, micro:bit, sensors and circuit components, logic analyzers)
- Printing equipment (office printer, sublimation printer, heat transfer equipment - *print your own t-shirts!*)

...and we regularly evaluate additional equipment based on community feedback, so feel free to suggest additional equipment.

For select equipment, the specifications and Standard Operating Procedures are available online. We also have a printed copy available in the space.
