## Overview

The Atten ST-862D Hot Air Soldering Rework Station is a versatile tool used for soldering and desoldering electronic components. It provides a controlled stream of hot air to remove and reflow surface mount components on PCBs.

## Risks

- **Burn Risk**: Hot air nozzle can reach high temperatures.
- **Overheating**: Continuous use at high temperatures may cause the station to overheat.
- **Component Damage**: Improper use of hot air can damage sensitive electronic components.
- **Hazardous Fumes**: Melting solder produces fumes that shoul

## Safety Precautions

- Keep the work area well-ventilated to prevent inhaling solder fumes.
- Turn off hot air rework station when not in use.
- Avoid touching nozzle and heated components during operation and cool down, or use heat-resistant gloves.

## Glossary

- **Hot Air Nozzle**: The attachment that emits hot air for soldering and desoldering. The nozzle is changeable depending on desired focus of hot air. 
- **PCB**: Printed Circuit Board, the board on which electronic components are mounted.
- **Reflow**: The process of melting and re-solidifying solder to join or remove components.

## Procedures

### Soldering with Hot Air

2. Attach the appropriate hot air nozzle to the handle.
1. Power on the Atten ST-862D and set the desired temperature using the control panel.
3. Place the PCB on a heat-resistant surface and secure it if necessary.
4. Apply flux to the solder pads and components to be soldered.
5. Hold the hot air nozzle about 2-3 cm above the solder joints and apply hot air in a circular motion until the solder melts and flows smoothly.
6. Remove the hot air and wait for the solder to solidify.
7. Inspect the solder joints for any defects and rework if necessary.

### Desoldering with Hot Air

2. Attach the appropriate hot air nozzle to the handle.
1. Power on the Atten ST-862D and set the desired temperature using the control panel.
3. Apply flux to the solder joints you want to desolder.
4. Hold the hot air nozzle about 2-3 cm above the solder joints and apply hot air until the solder melts.
5. Use tweezers or a desoldering tool to lift the component gently once the solder has melted.
6. Clean the pads and the component with a desoldering wick or vacuum to remove any remaining solder.
