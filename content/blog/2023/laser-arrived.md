Our OmTech 80W laser cutter has arrived! It has a 20in x 28in working area, an adjustable bed allowing you to engrave on much thicker materials, 
and a pass-through door allowing you to work with longer materials.
This beast of a machine is a big addition to our space, and we can't wait to see all the amazing projects that will come out of it.

The laser is up and runing, and we have completed our first test engraving. In true test run style, we even misaligned one of the hexagons in our own logo in LightBurn. Embarassing.

Of course, there's still some work to be done to get the laser ready for launch. We're still in the process of getting it calibrated,
and more importantly we need to finish setting up a ventilation to ensure a safe and comfortable working environment.

Despite these final touches, we're already getting excited for our grand opening. We can't wait to see what kinds of projects you all will bring to life with the help of our laser cutter.

Stay tuned for more updates and details on our official opening date.
