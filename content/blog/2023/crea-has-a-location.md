Exciting update: Crea officially has a location in Renton!

<!-- more -->

After several months of perseverance, we are thrilled to announce we are one major milestone closer to opening a makerspace in Renton. We finally have a location: 
[1000 SW 34th St, Suite C](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1000+SW+34th+St,+Suite+C,+Renton,+WA+98057).

The space is 3800 sq. ft. - definitely larger than our initial plan, but we can't wait to put the extra space to use, and we're even more excited to see how it will transform into a 
vibrant community space for makers of all skill levels.

Now that leasing and insurance challenges are behind us, we'll be very busy preparing the space and getting all of [our equipment](/equipment) ready for use. 
There is a lot of work to do before the space is open, and we'll be adding more photos of progress over the next few weeks, but we want to share some early (unpolished) glimpses inside the space.

We know many of you are eager to see the space in-person. It's still a bit too early to commit to a grand opening date,
but we're working hard toward opening the doors sometime in May. We can't wait to welcome you all in!
And until then, we're also happy to give a pre-launch tour to anyone who is interested. Just email {{ link(email="tony@creamakerspace.com") }} to schedule a visit.

Thank you for your patience and support as we work towards opening our doors.
