Our Grand Opening finally has a date: **Saturday, June 3 at 2pm**.

<!-- more -->

While there are still _several_ ongoing projects to improve the space (ask about them),
we want that to always be true.
The big question has been: "at what point is the space ready-enough to let the wider maker community
use the space and have more influence on future improvements?"

The answer is finally: **Now!** 

So this Saturday, we're officially opening Crea! Our Grand Opening will include:

- Tour of the space and equipment
- Swag that you'll help make
- Raffle for a free month of membership
- Snacks and drinks
- Meeting other Renton-area makers!

Stop by to be a part of our makerspace launch!
