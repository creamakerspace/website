We've been open for barely 2 months now, and we're ready to highlight several projects from the space showing off a range of creativity, ingenuity, and practicality. With no further ado:

{{ images(src=["2023/proj-lemonade.webp", "2023/proj-bathroom-upgrade.webp", "2023/proj-gate.webp"]) }}
{{ images(src=["2023/proj-bookcase-box.webp", "2023/proj-laptop-engrave.webp", "2023/proj-spice-rack.webp"]) }}

We hope you're inspired, and that you'll consider [joining](/join) our community of makers to work on your own projects!
