## What is a makerspace?

<p class="is-size-4">A shared workshop for making, inventing, and repairing things.</p>

Think of it as a gym, but instead of exercise and weight machines, we have equipment for making things.

Makerspaces vary significantly in the equipment available. Crea Makerspace has equipment for woodworking, CNC, laser cutting, 3D printing, t-shirt printing, robotics, and more. We aspire to evolve alongside the interests of our community here in Renton. Here are several photos from our makerspace:

If you already have projects in mind, [get a membership](/join), and use our equipment to finish your projects.

If you want a guided experience to discover what you're capable of making, [take a class](/classes).

If you want to see the space and ask questions, [take a free tour](https://calendly.com/creamakerspace/meet).
